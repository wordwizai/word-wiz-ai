## 💡 KEY STRATEGIC DECISIONS

### Why These 15 Pages?

**Target Audience:** Parents of K-2 students struggling with reading
- Overwhelmed, need practical solutions
- Search with specific, descriptive queries (long-tail)
- High intent to take action (sign up for tools)

**Keyword Selection Criteria:**
- **Low competition** - Small site can realistically rank
- **High intent** - Users actively solving a problem
- **Parent-focused** - Not teacher/researcher content
- **5-8 words long** - Specific, low-volume, low-competition

**Content Type Distribution:**
- 5 Programmatic Phonics Guides (CVC, blends, vowels, etc.)
- 4 Problem-Solution Articles (can't blend, guesses words, etc.)
- 3 Practice Method Guides (daily routine, 5-min activities, etc.)
- 3 Comparison Pages (AI vs traditional, tutor vs app, etc.)

### Programmatic SEO Approach

The 5 phonics skill pages use a **template + variables** system:
- **Template:** What are [skill]? Why [skill] matters? Common struggles with [skill]? How to teach [skill]? Practice activities. Progress checklist.
- **Variables:** Skill name, sound examples, practice sentences, teaching methods
- **Uniqueness:** 60%+ unique content per page (avoiding duplicate content penalties)

This makes future scalability easy - can add more phonics skills (digraphs, long vowels, syllable types) using the same template.
