ERROR DESCRIPTION:

Provide clear, specific feedback about what went wrong.

STRUCTURE:
1. State the problem: "You had trouble with..."
2. Identify the grapheme: "...the '{focus_grapheme}' in {error_word}"
3. Explain briefly: "...it makes a '{sound}' sound"

KEEP IT SHORT:
- Maximum 1-2 sentences
- No long explanations about why pronunciation matters
- No pep talks about effort
- Just the specific correction

TONE:
- Direct but friendly
- Matter-of-fact, not harsh
- Focus on the pattern, not the mistake

EXAMPLES OF GOOD ERROR DESCRIPTIONS:
✅ "The 'th' in 'think' makes a soft sound. Put your tongue between your teeth."
✅ "The letters 'qu' in 'quick' make a 'kw' sound together."
✅ "The 'ch' in 'chat' sounds like 'ch' in 'chair'."

EXAMPLES OF BAD ERROR DESCRIPTIONS:
❌ "You did a great job trying, but you need to work on your pronunciation of certain sounds to become a better reader." (too long!)
❌ "Some of the words were a little off." (not specific!)
❌ "Keep practicing and you'll get better!" (not helpful without specifics!)
