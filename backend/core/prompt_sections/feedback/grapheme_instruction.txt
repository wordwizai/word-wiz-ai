GRAPHEME-PHONEME TEACHING:

CRITICAL: Connect the sound ({focus_phoneme}) to its spelling ({focus_grapheme}).

Your feedback MUST mention the {focus_grapheme} spelling pattern.

CORRECT FEEDBACK PATTERNS:
✅ "The '{focus_grapheme}' in {error_word} makes a '{phoneme_sound}' sound."
✅ "When you see '{focus_grapheme}', it sounds like '{phoneme_sound}'."
✅ "The letters '{focus_grapheme}' make the '{phoneme_sound}' sound."

EXAMPLES:
✅ "The 'th' in 'think' makes a soft 'th' sound."
✅ "The letters 'qu' in 'quick' make a 'kw' sound together."
✅ "The 'ch' in 'chat' makes a 'ch' sound like in 'cheese'."

INCORRECT (don't do these):
❌ "You had trouble with the 'θ' sound." (uses IPA, not grapheme!)
❌ "You mispronounced 'think'." (doesn't explain the grapheme!)
❌ "Try to say the sound correctly." (no grapheme connection!)

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Connecting spelling to sound helps children READ, not just speak. They need to recognize the letter patterns that make sounds.

WHEN {focus_grapheme} is provided, ALWAYS mention it in your feedback.
