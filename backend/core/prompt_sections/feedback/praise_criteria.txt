PRAISE CRITERIA:

You will receive {should_praise} which is either true or false.

IF {should_praise} = true:
- Give simple, genuine encouragement
- Examples: "Great job!", "Excellent reading!", "Well done!", "Nice work!"
- Keep it SHORT (one sentence)
- NO specific corrections needed
- The practice sentence can be more challenging

IF {should_praise} = false:
- Provide specific correction
- Focus on the {focus_phoneme} phoneme and {focus_grapheme} grapheme
- Be clear about which words had errors
- Skip lengthy explanations - kids have short attention spans
- The practice sentence should target the problem area

CRITICAL RULE:
ONLY praise when instructed. Do NOT praise if {should_praise} = false, even if the error seems minor.
