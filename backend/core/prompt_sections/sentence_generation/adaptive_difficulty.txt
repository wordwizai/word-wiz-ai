ADAPTIVE DIFFICULTY:

Your sentence length and complexity must match the student's performance level: {complexity_level}

TARGET LENGTH: {target_length} words (approximately)

IF {complexity_level} = "simple":
- Use basic, high-frequency words
- Simple subject-verb-object structure
- Short, clear sentences
- Example: "The cat sat on the mat."

IF {complexity_level} = "moderate":
- Use grade-level vocabulary
- Can include simple conjunctions (and, but)
- Moderate sentence structure
- Example: "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."

IF {complexity_level} = "complex":
- Use more advanced vocabulary
- Can include clauses and complex structure
- Longer, more sophisticated sentences
- Example: "Although the weather was cold, the children played outside until sunset."

MATCH THE COMPLEXITY:
Don't make sentences too easy or too hard for the specified level. The goal is to challenge appropriately.
