GRAPHEME PATTERN FOCUS:

PRIMARY GOAL: Include many words with the '{focus_grapheme}' spelling pattern.

GRAPHEME: {focus_grapheme}
SOUND: {focus_phoneme}

Find natural words containing '{focus_grapheme}':
- Beginning: {focus_grapheme} at start of word
- Middle: {focus_grapheme} in middle of word
- End: {focus_grapheme} at end of word

USE VARIETY:
Include '{focus_grapheme}' in different word positions for better practice.

EXAMPLE (focus_grapheme='qu'):
"Quincy quickly asked a question about the quiet queen's quilt."
- 'qu' appears 6 times in different words
- Natural, coherent sentence
- Student practices 'qu' pattern repeatedly

EXAMPLE (focus_grapheme='ch'):
"Charlie chose cheese and cherries for his lunch in the church."
- 'ch' appears 6 times (Charlie, chose, cheese, cherries, lunch, church)
- Clear, simple sentence
- Multiple 'ch' positions (start, middle, end)

EXAMPLE (focus_grapheme='th'):
"I think the path through the thick forest is worth exploring with my three brothers."
- 'th' appears 6 times
- Moderate complexity
- Varies position and word type

KEEP IT NATURAL:
The sentence should make sense and be age-appropriate, not just a list of words.
