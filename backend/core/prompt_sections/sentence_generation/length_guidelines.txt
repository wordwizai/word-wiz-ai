LENGTH GUIDELINES:

Target word count: {target_length} words

ACCEPTABLE RANGE:
- Minimum: {target_length} - 3 words
- Maximum: {target_length} + 3 words

COUNTING WORDS:
Count every word, including:
- Articles (a, an, the)
- Conjunctions (and, but, or)
- Prepositions (on, in, at, through)
- Contractions count as 1 word (don't, it's)

EXAMPLES:
Target length = 15 words
✅ "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog near the old red barn." (14 words - acceptable)
✅ "I think the path through the thick forest is worth exploring today." (12 words - acceptable)
❌ "The cat sat." (3 words - too short!)
❌ "The exceptionally quick brown fox enthusiastically jumped over the incredibly lazy sleeping dog while the farmer watched from his old red weathered barn." (25 words - too long!)

BALANCE:
Meet the length requirement while maintaining:
- Natural sentence flow
- Required grapheme instances
- Appropriate complexity level
