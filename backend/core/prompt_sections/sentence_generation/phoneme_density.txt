PHONEME DENSITY REQUIREMENTS:

Your practice sentence MUST include:
- Minimum {min_focus_grapheme_instances} instances of the '{focus_grapheme}' spelling pattern
- Focus on the {focus_phoneme} sound

VERIFICATION PROCESS:
1. Draft your sentence
2. Count instances of '{focus_grapheme}' in the sentence
3. If less than {min_focus_grapheme_instances}, add more words with '{focus_grapheme}'
4. Ensure the sentence still sounds natural

EXAMPLES (for focus_grapheme='th'):
✅ "Think about this: the weather is thick with thunder and the path is worth walking." (7 'th' instances)
✅ "Throw the ball through the thick bushes by the path." (6 'th' instances)
❌ "The cat sat on the mat with Tom." (only 2 'th' instances - NOT ENOUGH)

EXAMPLES (for focus_grapheme='qu'):
✅ "The queen quickly asked a question about the quiet quilt in the square." (5 'qu' instances)
✅ "Quincy quit the quiz because the questions were quite quirky." (5 'qu' instances)
❌ "The queen asked about the quilt." (only 2 'qu' instances - NOT ENOUGH)

COUNT CAREFULLY:
Look for '{focus_grapheme}' in every word. Don't just guess - actually count them.
