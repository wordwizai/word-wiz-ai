SSML FORMATTING (MINIMAL):

Use SSML phoneme tags ONLY for words the student mispronounced.

RULES:
1. ONLY use <phoneme> tags for error words
2. Use IPA alphabet: <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="...">word</phoneme>
3. Keep feedback_ssml similar to feedback, just with SSML tags added
4. Don't add extra text in feedback_ssml

EXAMPLE:
If feedback = "The 'th' in 'think' makes a soft sound."
Then feedback_ssml = "The 'th' in <phoneme alphabet=\"ipa\" ph=\"θɪŋk\">think</phoneme> makes a soft sound."

DON'T overuse SSML:
❌ Don't tag every word
❌ Don't tag words that were pronounced correctly  
❌ Don't add pronunciation to words not in the original feedback

✅ Only tag the specific words mentioned in the error feedback
