# iOS Audio Playback Fix

## Issue
Mobile audio feedback was not working on iOS devices due to Safari's strict autoplay policies. The app would try to play audio programmatically without user interaction, which iOS blocks by default.

## Solution
Implemented an iOS-compatible audio playback system that:

1. **Initializes audio context during user gesture**: When the user starts recording (which is a user gesture), we initialize the AudioContext, which allows us to play audio later.

2. **Uses AudioContext API with fallback**: The system first tries to use the more robust AudioContext API, which works better on mobile devices, and falls back to HTML5 Audio if needed.

3. **Graceful error handling**: If audio still fails to play automatically, the system logs appropriate warnings instead of breaking the user experience.

## Technical Implementation

### New Hook: `useIOSCompatibleAudio`
- Manages AudioContext initialization and audio playback
- Handles iOS-specific requirements for audio playback
- Provides fallback mechanisms for different browser capabilities

### Modified Component: `BasePractice.tsx`
- Integrates the new audio hook
- Initializes audio context when recording starts (user gesture)
- Uses the iOS-compatible playback method for audio feedback

## User Experience
- Audio feedback should now work properly on iOS devices
- No changes to the user interface or workflow
- Users will hear audio feedback after pronunciation analysis, just as intended

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ iOS Safari (mobile)
- ✅ Android Chrome (mobile)
- ✅ Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ✅ Graceful degradation for older browsers
