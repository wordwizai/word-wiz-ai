Lexia provides comprehensive assessment and intervention, Raz-Kids offers affordable reading practice, and Word Wiz AI delivers pronunciation feedback. Many schools successfully use combinations: Lexia + Word Wiz AI for intervention with pronunciation support, or Raz-Kids + Word Wiz AI for an affordable, complete solution. If budget allows, all three together create a comprehensive literacy program."
