        "Your child writes 'dog' as 'bog' and 'bed' as 'ded.' They constantly flip b and d, making reading and spelling frustrating for everyone. Letter reversals, especially b and d confusion, are one of the most common concerns parents have about reading development. Here's the reassuring news: b/d confusion is completely normal for children under age 7-8 and responds well to targeted practice. This confusion doesn't automatically signal dyslexia or a learning disability. It's a predictable developmental stage. With the right multisensory strategies and practice, most children eliminate b/d confusion within 4-6 weeks.",

For everything else in a child's world, mirror images are the same thing: a chair facing left is still a chair, a cup turned around is still a cup, your face in the mirror is still you. Children's brains are trained by experience to ignore orientation. Then we introduce letters, where orientation suddenly matters, and we expect them to immediately distinguish b from d. This is a huge cognitive leap that takes time and practice.",
