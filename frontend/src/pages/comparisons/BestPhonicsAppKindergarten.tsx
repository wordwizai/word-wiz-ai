        "Your kindergartener is falling behind in reading. While classmates are sounding out CVC words and reading simple books, your child still struggles with letter sounds or can't blend sounds together. You need targeted help, and in-person tutoring at $50-100 per hour isn't always practical or affordable. Phonics apps can provide systematic instruction at a fraction of the cost, but you'll find dozens of options that vary wildly in quality. The best apps for struggling kindergarteners deliver systematic phonics instruction, engage multiple senses, provide pronunciation feedback, and adjust to your child's pace. This review examines five top apps to help you choose the right one.",
