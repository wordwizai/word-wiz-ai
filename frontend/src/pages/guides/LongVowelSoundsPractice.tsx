        "Your first grader has mastered letter sounds and can read simple CVC words like 'cat' and 'dog.' Now it's time for a major leap: long vowel sounds. Unlike short vowels that make quick, clipped sounds, long vowels 'say their names'—A says /ay/ like in 'cake,' E says /ee/ like in 'feet,' I says /eye/ like in 'bike,' O says /oh/ like in 'boat,' and U says /yoo/ or /oo/ like in 'cube' or 'flute.' Understanding long vowels unlocks thousands of common words and transforms your child from a beginning reader to someone who can tackle real books. With the right practice sequence and activities in this guide, most first graders master long vowel sounds in 6-8 weeks of consistent daily practice.",

These sounds are called 'long' not because they take longer to say, but to distinguish them from their short vowel counterparts: short A (cat), short E (bed), short I (sit), short O (hot), short U (cup).",
