        "Your child has mastered short vowels and can read CVC words like 'cat,' 'dog,' and 'sun' with confidence. The next step is silent e words. Words like 'cake,' 'bike,' and 'home' follow the magic e pattern where adding a silent e to the end changes the short vowel into a long vowel. This pattern appears in thousands of English words and unlocks a new level of reading fluency. The challenge is that silent e is invisible when reading aloud. Your child must recognize the pattern, remember the rule, and apply it automatically. With consistent practice using these exercises, most children master silent e words within 4-6 weeks.",

        "The silent e pattern (also called 'magic e' or 'bossy e') is one of the most important spelling patterns in English. The rule is simple: when a word ends with a consonant + e, the e is silent, and it makes the vowel before it 'say its name' (become a long vowel). Examples: cap → cape (short a becomes long a), kit → kite (short i becomes long i), hop → hope (short o becomes long o). Understanding this pattern unlocks hundreds of new words instantly.",

Alternative names include 'bossy e' (the e bosses the vowel around) and 'sneaky e' (it's there but you don't hear it).",
