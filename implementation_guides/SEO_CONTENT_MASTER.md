## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Conversion to React Components

Each page above follows this structure for easy component creation:

```tsx
import ArticlePageTemplate from "@/components/ArticlePageTemplate";
// or ComparisonPage for comparison pages

const [ComponentName] = () => {
  const content: ArticleSection[] = [
    // Convert outline to ArticleSection objects
  ];

  const relatedArticles = [
    // 3-4 internal links to related content
  ];

  const structuredData = {
    // Schema.org JSON-LD markup
  };

  return (
    <ArticlePageTemplate
      metaTitle="[Title from above]"
      metaDescription="[Description from above]"
      canonicalUrl="[URL from above]"
      // ... other props
      content={content}
      relatedArticles={relatedArticles}
      structuredData={structuredData}
    />
  );
};

export default [ComponentName];
```

### Internal Linking Strategy

Every page links to 3-5 related pages:
- Programmatic phonics pages link to each other and to problem-solution pages
