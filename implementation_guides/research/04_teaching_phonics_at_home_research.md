### Section 1: Understanding Phonics Basics (Foundation Knowledge)

**What Are Phonemes?**
- Phonemes = smallest units of sound in language
- English has 44 phonemes (despite 26 letters)
- Examples:
  - "cat" = 3 phonemes: /k/ /æ/ /t/
  - "ship" = 3 phonemes: /ʃ/ /ɪ/ /p/ (even though 4 letters)
  - "cheese" = 3 phonemes: /ch/ /ee/ /z/

**Phonics vs Sight Words**
- Phonics = Decoding using letter-sound relationships
- Sight words = Memorized words (the, was, said)
- Research shows phonics should come first (80/20 rule)
- Sight words should be taught alongside phonics, not instead

**The Phonics Progression (Synthetic Phonics)**
1. Individual letter sounds (s, a, t, p, i, n)
2. CVC words (consonant-vowel-consonant: cat, sit, mop)
3. Consonant digraphs (ch, sh, th, wh, ck)
4. Consonant blends (bl, cr, st, nd)
5. Long vowels and vowel teams (ai, ee, oa, igh)
6. R-controlled vowels (ar, er, ir, or, ur)
7. Advanced patterns (tion, ough, etc.)

**Key Principle:** Systematic and Explicit
- Don't skip steps
- Teach one concept at a time
- Practice until mastery before moving on

### Section 3: 10 Phonics Activities for Home

**Activity 1: Sound Sorting**
- Materials: Objects or pictures
- How: Sort by beginning sound (all /b/ sounds together)

- Time: 5-10 minutes

**Activity 2: Letter Sound Matching**
- Materials: Letter cards, picture cards
- How: Match letter to picture with that sound
- Practice: Both ways (letter → sound, sound → letter)

**Activity 3: Blending Practice**
- Parent says sounds: "/c/ /a/ /t/"
- Child blends: "cat!"
- Start with 3-sound words, progress to 4-5 sounds
- **Use Word Wiz AI for pronunciation check**

**Activity 4: Segmenting Words**
- Parent says word: "dog"
- Child segments: "/d/ /o/ /g/"
- Use counters/blocks for each sound
- Builds phonemic awareness

**Activity 5: Build-A-Word**
- Materials: Letter tiles or magnetic letters
- Parent says word, child builds it
- Check letter order and spelling
- Read word aloud when done

**Activity 6: Word Families Practice**
- Focus on one pattern (-at family: cat, bat, sat, rat)
- Make list together
- Read aloud and practice
- **Word Wiz AI can check pronunciation**

**Activity 7: Hunt for Sounds**
- Pick target sound (/sh/ for example)
- Find objects in house with that sound
- Write list of words together
- Read list aloud

**Activity 8: Dictation Practice**
- Start simple (CVC words: cat, dog, pin)

### Section 4: Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Going Too Fast**
- Problem: Skipping to complex patterns before mastering basics
- Solution: Ensure mastery (90%+ accuracy) before progressing
- Timeframe: Stay on CVC words for weeks if needed

**Mistake 2: Skipping Blending Practice**
- Problem: Child knows sounds but can't blend them
- Solution: Daily blending practice (5 minutes minimum)
- Technique: Model slow blending, gradually speed up

**Mistake 3: Not Checking Pronunciation**
- Problem: Child reads with errors that become habits
- Solution: Listen carefully, correct gently
- **Tool: Use Word Wiz AI for objective pronunciation feedback**
- Why it matters: Pronunciation errors affect spelling later

**Mistake 4: Using Non-Decodable Books Too Early**
- Problem: Leveled readers encourage guessing
- Solution: Stick with decodable texts during phonics instruction
- Timing: Introduce predictable books after solid decoding skills

**Mistake 5: Making It Stressful**
- Problem: Pressure and frustration harm progress
- Solution: Keep sessions short (15 minutes), playful
- Mindset: Celebrate small wins, stay positive

**Mistake 6: Inconsistent Practice**
- Problem: Sporadic lessons = slower progress
- Solution: Daily practice, even if just 10-15 minutes
- Better: 15 minutes daily vs 2 hours on weekend
